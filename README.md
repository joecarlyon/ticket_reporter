# Chicago Ticket Reporter

Allows users to see if there are any outstanding tickets in Chicago. 
Everyone should be alerted of any tickets they may have but don't know about. I have been burned by this before.

## Requirements
Python 3

## Sample Usage
`python3 search_for_ticket.py -N X655504 -L Smith`

### Sample output
>You have 7 tickets
>
>`---------------------------------------------------------------------------`
>
>Ticket 9188958791 issued on 6/9/2015 has been resolved
>
>Ticket 6043562182 issued on 11/22/2015 has been resolved
>
>Ticket 6043742392 issued on 1/27/2016 has been resolved
